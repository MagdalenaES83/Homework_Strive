//exercise 2. Write code to check from two given integers whether one of them is 8 or their sum or difference is 8. 

let value1 = 2
let value2 = 5

if (value1 + value2 === 8) {console.log("sum is equal 8")}
else if (value1 === 8 || value2 === 8) {console.log("one or two values are equal 8")}
else {console.log("sum is diffrent than 8 ")}

else if ( second > first && second > third) {console.log(" second is the bigest number")}
else {console.log ("third is higest one")}

let number1 = 899885
let number2 = 2544
let result = (number2 + number1) / 2
console.log(result)
